<h1>Making This Site</h1>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been more focused on data science and programming, but I chose to make this site &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; to refresh my web development skills. I last used these skills when working as a React developer for ProMazo during my freshman year. But an web application framework like react isn&rsquo;t the right tool for this type of job. This site does not require user interaction, prompting me to use a static site generator (SSG).</p>
<p>I used Gatsby (a SSG built on top of React) for the last iteration of my website, but I wanted to try something new this time. I chose an SSG called Hugo to learn something new.</p>
<p>The excellent documentation on the Hugo site helped me go from a blank page to the site in front of you in a relatively short period of time. However, I chose a slightly more difficult path since I did not use a template. While templates are great for getting up and running, I wanted to learn more of the detail of how Hugo works.</p>
<p>Hugo&rsquo;s documentation does not have a direct path betwen an empty repository and a fully-fledged site since it focuses more on the majority of users who will use a template. For this reason, I sought out other resources from Hugo users about how to use Hugo without a template. I recommend the following resources for anyone seeking to create a Hugo site from scratch without a template:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://zwbetz.com/make-a-hugo-blog-from-scratch/">Zachary Wade Betz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Make a Hugo Blog From Scratch</a> I primarily used this article for the first steps of the process.</li>
<li><a href="https://digitaldrummerj.me/categories/#hugo">Justin James&rsquo; Hugo Blog Posts</a>: These posts contain miscellaneous information ranging from deployment to post series&rsquo; to outside integrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>I eventually plan to expand this post to contain more of the specific information I learned while creating this site.</p>
